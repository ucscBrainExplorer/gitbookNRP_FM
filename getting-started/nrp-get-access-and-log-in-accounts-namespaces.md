# NRP: Get Access & Log In (Accounts, Namespaces)

Before you can run anything, you need a **Nautiilus account** and **permission to use a namespace** (like a project folder) inside the cluster. For this project, you'll be working in the **braingeneers namespace.**

### Step 1: Log in to the Portal

* Go to [https://nrp.ai/](https://nrp.ai/) and click **Log in (top right).**
* Choose CILogon and sign in with **your university or research institution**, via CILogon (UCSC students/staff choose this one)

_If this is your first time logging in, an account will be automatically created._

### Step 2: Get Added to a Namespace

* Students: Ask your PI/admin to add you to the proper _namespace_ (ex. braingeneers).
* Faculty/Researchers - If you need your own namespace, request admin access via the [NRP Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#nautilus-users:matrix.org). Admins can create multiple namespaces and invite users to their namespace.&#x20;

### Step 3: Verify Your Access

* **User (Student)**: After logging in, open the **Namespaces Manager** tab and the namespaces you belong to will appear in **bold.**
* **Admin**: Use the same page to create namespaces or add users once they have logged in.&#x20;

### ⚠️ <mark style="color:purple;">Make sure you read the cluster policies before using it.</mark>

* Read the [**NRP Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**](https://nrp.ai/NRP-AUP.pdf).
* Read the [**Cluster Policies**](https://nrp.ai/documentation/userdocs/start/policies/).
